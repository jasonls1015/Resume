# Resume Project

> This repo is under construction.

This is a test to experiment with Writerside using my resume as an example project with two single-sourced WebHelp outputs.

The WebHelp is synced to GitHub Pages, where each resume is presented according to the conditional settings for each Help Instance.

This project demonstrates the concepts of single-sourced authoring, and docs-as-code using Writerside as a standalone solution.
